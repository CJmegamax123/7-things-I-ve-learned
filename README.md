    <h1>Git</h1>
    <p>I've learned that Git is a ditributed version control system designed to handle projects with efficiency.
        In normal people words, that means that it's a system that allows multiple people to work on a project together smoothly and quickly.
    </p>
    <h2>Repository</h2>
    <p>I've learned that repositories are a storage space where projects' files and change history are kept.
        This effectively means that a repository is where the content and information of a project is held.
    </p>
    <h3>Branches</h3>
    <p>I've learned that branches are a seperated line of development from the same project, in a repository.
        Branches are actually one of the things I've found the most interesting (only behind Git itself) as of yet; as it not only enhances a teams ability to work together, but also allows things to be reviewed and revised before it even affects the main project.
    </p>
    <h4>Git Commands</h4>
    <p>These are the inputs, or as i call them "prompts" that tells Git what to do with the files of the repository.
    </p>
    <h5>Markdown</h5>
    <p>I've learned markdown is a way to add formating and structure to a text document.
       Markdown is interesting to me because it feels like writing a paper in both form and execution.
    </p>
    <h6>Markup</h6>
    <p>I've leaved markup is a set of rules that define how text/images are presented in a document.
        From the names, I assumed markup would somehow be the oppisite of markdown, but really it's just a part of how markdown functions.
    </p>
    <h7>HTML</h7>
    <p>I've learned that HTML, which stands for hypertext markup language, is the standard markup language for the internet.
        In terms of execution, it is similar to basic markup, but the prompts for it are more intuitive.
